work out solvency of group on grant#new

make preview page for groups, grants and comments; require for groups & grants

make splash page for /grants & /groups & default views

work on membership views

write helper method for default User & Group images

don't destroy grants, votes, or memberships on Group#destroy (unless none)

make pretty urls

figure out how to use redirect_back_or_default (session?)

defer: 

  Nifty Charts! voting imagery/vis. charts in the right column of group#show
  place group comments under the charts
  add some type of expiry so people aren't forced to act for unfavorable grants
  add table for email prefs
  give users control over their own comments
  put group comments in a partial and add column for opt. administrative approval
  maybe embed a forum app like altered_beast
  set model constant on create group: how much 'yea' authority to win a grant?
  change default naming (of images) for additional clarity
  clear %p tags before simple_format because it wraps its own

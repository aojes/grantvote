defer: add table for email prefs

people CAN vote on their own grants: yea vote created on grant creation

set model constant on create group: how much 'yea' authority to win a grant?

figure out how to use redirect_back_or_default

write helper method for default User & Group images

look into groups_grants_id pattern

find the best place to check membership for sup-path resources

add preview page for grants and comments; require for grants

prevent people from accessing sub-path resources

/ make small, square thumbnail images, like flickr

put group comments in a partial and add column for opt. administrative approval

don't destroy grants or votes(?) on Group#destroy

# Q. how to populate Users with lib/tasks/populate.rake  
      L: foo /E: foo@grantvote.com /P: foobar
         bar /   bar@grantvote.com /   foobar

add some type of expiry so people aren't forced to act for unfavorable grants

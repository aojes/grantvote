make preview page for grants and comments; require for grants

work on membership views

write helper method for default User & Group images

don't destroy grants, votes, or memberships on Group#destroy (unless none)

make pretty urls

_________________
done:
  people CAN vote on their own grants: yea vote created on grant creation
  make small, square thumbnail images, like flickr

_________________
defer: 
  add some type of expiry so people aren't forced to act for unfavorable grants
  add table for email prefs
  give users control over their own comments
  put group comments in a partial and add column for opt. administrative approval
  maybe embed a forum app like altered_beast
  set model constant on create group: how much 'yea' authority to win a grant?
  change default naming (of images) for additional clarity

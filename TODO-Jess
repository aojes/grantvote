   %li= show_link "Groups", groups_path,  :alt => "Groups index"
   # we can do this later.. we need to get the nuts & bolts of deployment ready
   
   Can you modify the show_link helper to include the alt? or probably define 
   them on controllers and add :alt=>'@title' or somethink like that. 
   # for now, alt & title attrs are fine for images
   
   
   I'll let you know if I figure out something more simple. Also groups_path 
   doesn't work, it has to be :controller=>'groups'
   
   # groups_path is working here now.  keep me posted. try migrating
     to VERSION=0, roll it forward, then rake db:populate_users & 
     rake db:populate  (just a guess)

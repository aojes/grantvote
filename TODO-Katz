    #fonts should always be in px and minimize use of em or pt. they would look fine on any browser
    
    i don't know what the .htc file is for, and i can't find it either
    #it would fix the problem with hovering elements (submit button) in IE6, IE7 and IE8 (yes, even IE8)
    
    (i think we should keep to the default nav for now)
    #alright.

    keep the nav touches for later.  focus on firefox linux development.
    don't let IE slow you down
    
    try to keep lines under 80 characters -------------------------------------<

   Beta invitation - only admin or moderator can send email invitations or approve requests - still working on it
   Later-when all the features are done: any user can send invites
   Note: Make sure id on Invitations table = id on Users table when you run rake db:populate_users
